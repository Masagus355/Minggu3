        <p>  The following video is a tribute to the rallying in the middle 80's<br>
            whence the Group B monster machines dominated the championship. <br>
        The tracks were extremely dangerous and the safety barriers were made out of the crowds.<br>
    Since the cars became as much as powerful as the F1 cars at the time,<br>
     it was too much for the human body to keep the monsters in the tracks.<br>
    And so, in 1986, after several horrible crashes,<br>
     The FIA banned Group B rally forever.</p>
